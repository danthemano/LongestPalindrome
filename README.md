# LongestPalindrome
This function takes as an input a string, and returns the longest palindrome substring

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because it checks the greatest palidrome substring starting
from each character of the string.

The space complexity of this problem is O(1) because it only create 3 variables.
